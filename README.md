# WeatherStar 4000+

## About

This is a fork of https://github.com/netbymatt/ws4kp which itself is a fork of https://github.com/vbguyny/ws4kp

## Changes

I missed the music from the original so I literally just embedded a Weather Channel Spotify playlist back into the page. That's about it. I plan to tweak this in the future and make it work better for a headless setup, such as on a Raspberry Pi.

## Disclaimer

Don't rely on this for any serious weather reporting please. This is just for fun.
